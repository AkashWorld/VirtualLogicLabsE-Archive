This folder contains all the files that contain code to run Integration Tests for our program. 
Unit tests can be run by opening up the editor, which can be downloaded at:
https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

Open the project folder at 1_code/VirtualLogicLabs/. After the project
is successfuly opened, simply go to the Window tab on the top of the editor
and choose the Test Runner option. Enter 'play mode' (a restart of the
editor may be required) and run the unit tests directly from there.
